# Educational-Impact-on-Student-Performance---Data-Analysis-Report

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of a Kaggle dataset on high school students' grades, focusing on math, reading, and writing scores, along with various influencing factors. The assignment examines the impact of parental education level and test preparation courses on students' performance.

## Key Findings
- **Math Score by Parental Level of Education**: No extreme differences were observed, but students whose parents had higher education levels showed slightly higher average scores.
- **Distribution of Math Scores**: Majority of students scored between 60% - 70%, with a bell-shaped curve indicating normal distribution.
- **Correlation Between Math and Writing Scores**: A strong correlation was found, with high math scores generally corresponding to high writing scores.
- **Impact of Test Preparation Course**: Students who took the course had higher average math scores.
- **Sampled vs Actual Data**: Analysis of sampled data shows less variability in math scores compared to the original dataset.
